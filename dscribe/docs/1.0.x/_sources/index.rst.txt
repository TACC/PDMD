DScribe is a Python package for transforming atomic structures into fixed-size
numerical fingerprints. These fingerprints are often called "descriptors" and
they can be used in various tasks, including machine learning, visualization,
similarity analysis, etc. To get started you can check the :doc:`basic tutorial
<tutorials/basics>`.

.. note::
   We are incrementally adding support for calculating the derivatives of
   descriptors with respect to the atom positions. In version **1.0.0** you
   can find an implementation for getting derivatives of non-periodic systems
   for the SOAP descriptor. Please check the :doc:`new documentation on
   derivatives <tutorials/derivatives>` and the new :doc:`new tutorial
   <tutorials/machine_learning/forces_and_energies>` on predicting energies and
   forces using these derivatives.

.. note::
   Version **1.0.x** introduces some improvements that are not directly
   backwards compatible with previous versions. Check the :doc:`changelog
   <changelog>` for details.
